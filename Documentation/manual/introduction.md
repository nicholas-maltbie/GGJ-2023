# GGJ Roots Project 2023

This is a multiplayer game where each player attempts to take control of the
forest through growing their own environment through a network of roots
and plants they grow across the map.

When placing plants, each player will gain some score.
First player to 100 points wins the game.

## How to Play

The game is inherently multiplayer but there is an option to `Play Offline`
if you want to play on your own to test out the game mechanics.

When you start a game, all players will be thrown into a lobby.

The host can start the game whenever they are ready by hitting
the `Start Game` button.

Once you start the game each player will spawn in with a tree and two
producer plants.

You can move your player around with `WASD` and place plants with the
`space` key. Use the mouse wheel to scroll between different plants
you want to play or click the plant on the bottom left panel
in the Plant Tableau.

## Placement Rules

There are some rules about how you can place plants, you can't just put them
anywhere on the map.

Plants need to be put within the `Grow Range` of your other plants.
The grow zone is the big green space that is visible around plants
with a grow zone like a cactus or tree.

Plants of the same type cannot be placed too close to each other as well.
That is shown.
